# üîê Crack Password using MD5 algorithm

## What is MD5?

MD5 stands for Message-Digest Algorithm 5.  
It is a cryptographic hash function that takes an input (like a password, file, or string) and produces a fixed-length 32-character hexadecimal hash.

## How it works?

MD5 takes input of any size and converts it into a fixed 128-bit (16 bytes) hash value.  
The output is usually displayed as a 32-character hexadecimal string.  
It is a one-way process: you can generate the hash from the original input, but you cannot retrieve the original input from the hash.  
Nowadays, MD5 is considered outdated and insecure for use in security-critical systems.


## Features

The application offers a user-friendly interface, supports input of custom dictionary files (.txt) containing candidate passwords, provides error handling, supports all MD5 hashes, and is case sensitive.
