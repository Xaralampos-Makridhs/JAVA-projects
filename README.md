# Java Projects Collection

This repository contains a collection of small Java projects. Each project is organized in its own folder and is designed to demonstrate core Java concepts through simple **management systems** such as student management, inventory tracking, or task management. These projects can serve as practice, educational tools, or the foundation for more advanced applications.
